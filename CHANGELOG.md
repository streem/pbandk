## [0.9.0] - 2020-12-23

[0.9.0]: https://github.com/streem/pbandk/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0

### Added

* Support for Kotlin/Native (PR [#76], fixes [#19]) (thanks @sebleclerc)
* JSON encoding/decoding improvements:
    * Support for the `json_name` protobuf field option
    * Custom encoding/decoding for most of the protobuf well-known types: `Duration`, `Timestamp`, `Empty`,  `Struct`, `Value`, `NullValue`, `ListValue`, and all wrapper types
    * Added `JsonConfig` class for configuring JSON encoding/decoding at runtime. Currently supported options include `ignoreUnknownFieldsInInput`, `outputDefaultValues`, and `outputProtoFieldNames` (which match the options documented at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json_options), and also `compactOutput`.
* New binary encoding and decoding overloads on Kotlin/JVM:
    * `Message.encodeToStream(java.io.OutputStream)`
    * `Message.Companion.decodeFromStream(java.io.InputStream)`
    * `Message.Companion.decodeFromByteBuffer(java.nio.ByteBuffer)`

### Changed

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Artifacts are now published to JCenter under new maven coordinates
    * Runtime library: `pro.streem.pbandk:pbandk-runtime-common:0.9.0`, `pro.streem.pbandk:pbandk-runtime-jvm:0.9.0`, `pro.streem.pbandk:pbandk-runtime-js:0.9.0`, `pro.streem.pbandk:pbandk-runtime-native:0.9.0`
    * Code generation plugin for the protobuf compiler: `pro.streem.pbandk:protoc-gen-kotlin-jvm:0.9.0:jvm8@jar`
    * `ServiceGenerator` library: `pro.streem.pbandk:protoc-gen-kotlin-lib-jvm:0.9.0`
* Projects that use `pbandk` can remove the `kotlinx-serialization` gradle plugin and library dependency if they don't use `kotlinx-serialization` themselves. The library is now an internal implementation detail of `pbandk`. (PR [#69], fixes [#61])
* Completely rewritten implementation of JSON encoding/decoding, fixing numerous bugs in the old version. The new implementation is much more compliant with the [official proto3 JSON spec](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). Remaining incompatibilities are tracked in [#72].
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Moved all of the binary and JSON encoding functionality, and most of the decoding functionality, from the generated code to the runtime library. Code generated by old versions of pbandk will not run with this new pbandk version.
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Changed `Message` so that it no longer extends from itself. Uses of `Message<T>` should be changed to just `Message`. (PR [#69])
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Added `@PbandkInternal` and `@PublicForGeneratedCode` annotations on portions of the public API that are only public for pbandk's internal use or for use from pbandk-generated code. Using these APIs outside of pbandk will generate compiler warnings and errors. If you have a need for using any of these APIs from your project, please file an issue on GitHub describing your use case.
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Code that calls any of pbandk's JSON encoding/decoding APIs must now opt-in to the `@ExperimentalProtoJson` annotation. See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/opt-in-requirements.html#opting-in-to-using-api for detailed instructions. Once pbandk's JSON APIs are no longer considered experimental, this annotation will be removed.
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Update the public API to follow recent naming conventions from the Kotlin standard library: "marshal"/"unmarshal" is replaced with "encode"/"decode", encoding methods are named `encodeTo*`, and decoding methods are named `decodeFrom*`. (PRs [#69], [#90], fixes [#89])
    * The below methods have been renamed and are now defined as extension methods rather than being part of the `Message` or `Message.Companion` interface. Code that calls these methods will now need to import them first.
        * `Message.protoMarshal()` -> `Message.encodeToByteArray()`
        * `Message.Companion.protoUnmarshal(ByteArray)` -> `Message.Companion.decodeFromByteArray(ByteArray)`
        * `Message.jsonMarshal()` -> `Message.encodeToJsonString()`
        * `Message.Companion.jsonUnmarshal(String)` -> `Message.Companion.decodeFromJsonString(String)`
        * `Message.protoMarshal(pbandk.Marshaller)` -> `Message.encodeWith(pbandk.MessageEncoder)`
    * The below methods have been renamed. They will become extension methods in a future pbandk release.
        * `Message.Companion.protoUnmarshal(pbandk.Unmarshaller)` -> `Message.Companion.decodeWith(pbandk.MessageDecoder)`
    * The below methods have been renamed and are now defined as extension methods rather than being part of the `Message` or `Message.Companion` interface. Code that calls these methods will now need to import them first. The `Json` parameter from `kotlinx-serialization` has been replaced with the new `JsonConfig` type from `pbandk`.
        * `Message.jsonMarshal(kotlinx.serialization.json.Json)` -> `Message.encodeToJsonString(pbandk.json.JsonConfig)`
        * `Message.Companion.jsonUnmarshal(kotlinx.serialization.json.Json, String)` -> `Message.Companion.decodeFromJsonString(String, pbandk.json.JsonConfig)`
    * Replaced `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` interfaces with `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` interfaces, which are much simpler and function differently from the previous interfaces
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** `MessageMap.entries` is now a `Set` instead of a `List`

### Removed

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Removed `Sizer` and `Util` from the public API
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Removed `UnknownField` constructors and the `UnknownField.size()` method from the public API

### Fixed

* Crash on Android when encoding `google.protobuf.Timestamp` fields to JSON (PR [#82], fixes [#46])
* `StackOverflowError` when generating code for really large `oneof` objects (PR [#52]) (thanks @tinder-aminghadersohi)
* Performance problems when compiling generated code with Kotlin 1.4 (PR [#101], fixes [#94])
* JSON decoding of unknown enum values (PR [#100])
* Map entry size computation for non-MessageMap maps (PR [#99])
* Some bugs with the handling of `packed` fields, binary encoding of enums in Kotlin/JS, and base64 encoding/decoding in Kotlin/JS (PR [#69], fixes [#23])
* Various conformance test failures (PRs [#80], [#82])

## [0.8.1] - 2020-05-22

[0.8.1]: https://github.com/streem/pbandk/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1

### Added

* Enable conformance tests for Kotlin/JS

### Changed

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Update to kotlin 1.3.72 and kotlinx.serialization 0.20.0. Projects that depend on `pbandk` must be using the same versions of kotlin and kotlinx.serialization. (fixes [#35])
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** The `pbandk-runtime-common` maven package is now just called `pbandk-runtime`. The `protoc-gen-kotlin-jvm` maven package is now called `protoc-gen-kotlin-lib-jvm`. The `pbandk-runtime-jvm` and `pbandk-runtime-js` packages have not changed names.
* Use the new Kotlin multiplatform gradle plugin instead of the deprecated plugin (thanks @sebleclerc)
* Switch from Groovy to Kotlin for build.gradle files (thanks @sebleclerc)
* Update to gradle 6.2.2 (thanks @sebleclerc)
* Use the `maven-publish` gradle plugin instead of the `maven` plugin (thanks @sebleclerc)

### Fixed

* Name collision with nested types (fixes [#24]) (thanks @sebleclerc)
* Fix gradle configs for all examples and build them in CI so they don't break in the future (fixes [#37] and [#41])
